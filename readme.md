# Web Dev Blog

This is the code for my own web development site which hosts my portfolio and blog.

You can see it live @ [jeremybratcher.com](https://www.jeremybratcher.com).

This project intends to create Laravel/Vue CMS for the pupose of a web developers blog and portfolio site.

Some features:
    * SPA architecture for seemless loading and transitions, better user experience
    * Ability to add new resources to API easily by convenient naming conventions (ex. 'reesouce-item')
    * Full CRUD operations for resources
    * Default blog post, portfolio item, and tutorial API resources
    * User authentication
    * User Dashboard to create, edit, and delete resources
    * Markdown editor for easy resource creation and editing

One goal of this project is to create an easy to learn and modify CMS framework that fulfills all the requriements of a professional web site for a web developer that has a blog, portfolio, and an online method of contact.

Attempts have been made to write models and components in a way to allow new resources to be easilty added and components to be reusable.

This is written as a monolith with the Vue SPA housed inside the Larave app.
